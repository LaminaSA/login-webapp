# Simple Web app with log in capabilities

### Introduction to Flask
---

Flask is a lightweight, micro web development framework for Python. Compared to the higher-level frameworks, it’s much more flexible and, best of all, it doesn’t get in your way as you’re building out your web site. You can add complexity as your application grows. It’s great for beginners who want to better understand the shortcuts that larger, high-level web frameworks employ.


### This webapp
This is a small foray into the workings of flask. Creating different routes and making them accessible through a nabvar is something I wanted to experiment with.
I also wanted to experiment with login capabilities 
### Future iterations
- I aim to use css templates to organise the appearance and format of the pages
- I also aim to include a quiz which can serve as a language learning tool
- I also want to add sign up capabilities and a database to store registered users.
